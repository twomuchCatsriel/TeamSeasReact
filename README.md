# TeamSeasReact
A school project where we had to make a website for a Non-profit. I got to choose #TeamSeas because I think they're awesome.

# Stack
This project is built using Vite's REACT Template, without a framework. I considered using Next.JS, but since I'm still not entirely comfortable around REACT as of starting this project, I decided against it.
While in it's current state, it does not use any backend features, the plan is to use REACT.JS for the frontend, and either Node.js or C# as the backend, as those are the languages I think I'd be the most comfortable with. 
(Node.js since I'm comfortable with JavaScript, and C# since I've used the language a fair bit before).

I was also considering using Tailwind CSS, but I opted against it since It would be the first time I'd have used it. (And I'm not confident that it even works with VITE / REACT)

# How do I run this?
To run this project, you must open it in visual Studio.
Using the command line, run these commands:

> cd GoTeamSeas

> npm run dev

Doing this will open a developer sever, allowing you to run the site.
This project is NOT FINISHED YET, so it has not been built.
